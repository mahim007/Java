Constructors
------------
-- once we create and object compulsory we perform initialization, then only the object is in a position to respond
    properly.
-- whenever we are creating an object some piece of the code will be executed automatically to perform initialization of
    the object. this piece of the code is noting but constructor. Hence the main purpose of constructor is to perform
    initialization of an object, but not to create object.

difference between constructor and instance block
-------------------------------------------------
-- other than initialization if we want to perform any activity for every object creation then we should go for instance
    block (like updating one entry in the database for every object creation or incrementing count value for every
    object creation)
-- both constructor and instance block have their own different purposes and replacing one concept with another concept
    may not work always.
-- both constructor and instance block will be executed for every object creation, but instance block first followed by
    constructor.
-- demo program to print a number of objects created for a class. -> CountDemo.java

Constructor properties
----------------------
-- name of the class and name of the constructor must be matched.
-- return type concept not applicable for constructor even void also.
-- by mistake if we are trying to declare return type for the constructor then we won't get any compile time error,
    because compiler treats it as a method. -> NotConstructor.java
    it's valid to have a method whose name is same as class name, but it's not a good practice.
