Singleton class
---------------
definition:
    For any java class if we are allowed to create only one object, such type of class is called singleton class.
    i.e. Runtime, BusinessDelegate, ServiceLocator

advantages:
    if several people have same requirement then it's not recommended creating a separate object for every requirement. we
    have to create only one object, and we have to reuse that object so that performance and memory utilization will be
    improved. this is the central idea of singleton classes.

how to create singleton classes
-------------------------------
we can create our own singleton classes for this we have to use private constructor and private static variable and public
factory method.

Approach 1:
    see Test.java
    Runtime class is internally implemented this approach.

Approach 2:
    see Test1.java

class is not final, but we are not allowed to create child classes, how to do it?
-- by declaring every constructor private in parent we can restrict child class creation.
