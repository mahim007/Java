FileWriter:
-----------
We can use FileWriter to write character data to the file.

Constructors:
-------------
1. FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(String fileName);
2. FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(File f);

The above file writers meant for overriding of existing data. instead of overriding, if we want append operation, then
we have to create file writer by using the following constructors.

3. FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(String fileName, boolean append);
4. FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(File f, boolean append);

Note: if the specified file is not already available then all the above constructors will create that file.

Methods present in FileWriter
-----------------------------
1. write(int ch); to write a single character to the file. i.e. fw.write('a'); or fw.write(97);
2. write(char[] ch); to write an array of characters to the file.
3. write(String s); to write string to the file.
4. flush(); to give the guarantee that total data including last character will be returned to the file.
5. close(); to close the pipeline of the writer.

Note: The main problem with a FileWriter is we have to insert line separator ('\n') manually. which is varied from
    system to system. it is difficulty to the programmer.
    we can solve this problem by using BufferedWriter and PrintWriter classes.
