FileReader
----------
we can use FileReader to read character data from the file.

Constructors
------------
1. FileReader fr = new FileReader(String fileName);
2. FileReader fr = new FileReader(File f);

Methods
-------
1. int read(); returns the unicode value, if the next character not available then this method returns -1.
    as this method returns unicode value (int value), at the time of printing we have to perform typecasting.
    see example Test5.java

2. int read(char[] ch); it attempts to read, enough characters from the file into char array and returns number of
    characters copied.
