PrintWriter
-----------
It is the most enhanced Writer to write character data to the file. the main advantage of PrintWriter over FileWriter and
BufferedWriter is we can write any type of primitive data directly to the file.

Constructors
------------
1. PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(String fileName);
2. PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(File f);
3. PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(Writer w);

Note
----
PrintWriter can communicate directly with the file and also via some Writer object also.
The most enhanced writer to write character data to the file is PrintWriter, whereas the most enhanced reader to read
character data from the file is BufferedReader.

Methods
-------
1. write(int ch)
2. write(char[] ch)
3. write(String s)
4. flush()
5. close()
-----
6. print(char ch)
7. print(int i)
8. print(double d)
9. print(boolean b)
10. print(String s)
-----
11. println(char ch)
12. println(int i)
13. println(double d)
14. println(boolean b)
15. println(String s)

example: Test9.java

Difference between write(100) and print(100) ?
ans: in the case of write(100) the corresponding character 'd' will be added to the file but in the case of print(100)
    the int value 100 will be added to the file directly.

In general we can use readers and writers to handle character data (text data), whereas we can use streams to handle
binary data like images, pdf files, video files, audio files etc.

we can OutputStream to write binary data to the file, InputStream to read binary data from the file.
1. character data (to handle Reader and Writer is avaiable)
2. binary data: image, video, audio, pdf, jar etc (to handle OutputStream, InputStream)
